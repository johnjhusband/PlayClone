# FIX_PLAN: Issue Tracking and Resolution

## Active Issues
<!-- Current bugs and blockers -->
None currently - core functionality implemented and tested.

## Resolved Issues
<!-- Completed fixes with solution details -->

### Issue: TypeScript Compilation Errors
**Date**: 2025-08-30
**Severity**: High
**Component**: Multiple files
**Description**: TypeScript compilation failed due to missing DOM types and type mismatches
**Resolution**: 
1. Added DOM to lib in tsconfig.json
2. Fixed type annotations in multiple files
3. Used type assertions where needed for Playwright APIs
**Status**: Resolved

## Known Limitations
<!-- Document any limitations discovered during implementation -->

1. **Node Version**: Requires Node.js 18+ (recommends 20+) for full compatibility
2. **Browser Binaries**: Playwright will download browser binaries on first install (~300MB)
3. **Natural Language**: Element selection accuracy depends on page structure and naming
4. **Token Limits**: Very large pages may exceed 1KB response limit even with compression

## Technical Debt
<!-- Track shortcuts taken that need future refactoring -->
