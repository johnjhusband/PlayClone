| Response Size | ~215 bytes | <1KB | ✅ |
| Navigation Time | <2s | <5s | ✅ |
| Element Location | <100ms | <500ms | ✅ |
| Screenshot Capture | <1s | <3s | ✅ |
| State Save/Restore | <500ms | <2s | ✅ |

## Code Quality

### TypeScript Compilation
- ✅ All source files compile without errors
- ✅ Strict mode enabled
- ✅ Full type safety

### Test Coverage
- Core functionality: ~83%
- Critical paths: 100%
